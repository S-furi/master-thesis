            abstract = {Computer simulation was first pioneered as a scientific
                        tool in meteorology and nuclear physics in the period
                        following World War II, but it has grown rapidly to
                        become indispensible in a wide variety of scientific
                        disciplines, including astrophysics, high-energy physics,
                        climate science, engineering, ecology, and economics.
                        Digital computer simulation helps study phenomena of
                        great complexity, but how much do we know about the
                        limits and possibilities of this new scientific practice?
                        How do simulations compare to traditional experiments?
                        And are they reliable? Eric Winsberg seeks to answer
                        these questions in Science in the Age of Computer
                        Simulation. Scrutinizing these issue with a philosophical
                        lens, Winsberg explores the impact of simulation on such
                        issues as the nature of scientific evidence; the role of
                        values in science; the nature and role of fictions in
                        science; and the relationship between simulation and
                        experiment, theories and data, and theories at different
                        levels of description. Science in the Age of Computer
                        Simulation will transform many of the core issues in
                        philosophy of science, as well as our basic understanding
                        of the role of the digital computer in the sciences.},

                        , within the framework of the stochastic formulation of
                        chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially
                        homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact
                        through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction
                        channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented,
                        Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be
                        particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior
                        of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular
                        species participate in many highly coupled chemical
                        reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which
                        fluctuations and correlations play no significant role,
                        the method stands as an alternative to the traditional
                        procedure of numerically solving the deterministic
                        reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near
                        chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and
                        correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations,
                        the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically
                        examining the predictions of the stochastic master
                        equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially
                        homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation
                        algorithm presented here is more directly based on a
                        newly defined entity called “the reaction probability
                        density function.” The purpose of this article is to
                        describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and
                        to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical
                        and mathematical validity; numerical applications to
                        specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent

                        of chemical equations: as continuous, represented by
                        differential equations whose variables are concentrations
                        , or as discrete, represented by stochastic processes
                        whose variables are numbers of molecules. Although the
                        former is by far more common, systems with very small
                        numbers of molecules are important in some applications
                        (e.g., in small biological cells or in surface
                        processes). In both views, most complicated systems with
                        multiple reaction channels and multiple chemical species
                        cannot be solved analytically. There are exact numerical
                        simulation methods to simulate trajectories of discrete,
                        stochastic systems, (methods that are rigorously
                        equivalent to the Master Equation approach) but these do
                        not scale well to systems with many reaction pathways.
                        This paper presents the Next Reaction Method, an exact
                        algorithm to simulate coupled chemical reactions that is
                        also efficient: it (a) uses only a single random number
                        per simulation event, and (b) takes time proportional to
                        the logarithm of the number of reactions, not to the
                        number of reactions itself. The Next Reaction Method is
                        extended to include time-dependent rate constants and
                        non-Markov processes and is applied to a sample
                        application in biology (the lysis/lysogeny decision
                        circuit of lambda phage). The performance of the Next
                        Reaction Method on this application is compared with one
                        standard method and an optimized version of that standard
                        method. },
