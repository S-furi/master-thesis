            abstract = {Computer simulation was first pioneered as a scientific
                        tool in meteorology and nuclear physics in the period
                        following World War II, but it has grown rapidly to
                        become indispensible in a wide variety of scientific
                        disciplines, including astrophysics, high-energy physics,
                        climate science, engineering, ecology, and economics.
                        Digital computer simulation helps study phenomena of
                        great complexity, but how much do we know about the
                        limits and possibilities of this new scientific practice?
                        How do simulations compare to traditional experiments?
                        And are they reliable? Eric Winsberg seeks to answer
                        these questions in Science in the Age of Computer
                        Simulation. Scrutinizing these issue with a philosophical
                        lens, Winsberg explores the impact of simulation on such
                        issues as the nature of scientific evidence; the role of
                        values in science; the nature and role of fictions in
                        science; and the relationship between simulation and
                        experiment, theories and data, and theories at different
                        levels of description. Science in the Age of Computer
                        Simulation will transform many of the core issues in
                        philosophy of science, as well as our basic understanding

                        chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially
                        homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact
                        through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction
                        channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented,
                        Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be
                        particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior
                        of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular
                        species participate in many highly coupled chemical
                        reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which

                        the method stands as an alternative to the traditional
                        procedure of numerically solving the deterministic
                        reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near

                        correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations,

                        examining the predictions of the stochastic master
                        equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially
                        homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation
                        algorithm presented here is more directly based on a
                        newly defined entity called “the reaction probability
                        density function.” The purpose of this article is to
                        describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and
                        to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical
                        and mathematical validity; numerical applications to

                        of chemical equations: as continuous, represented by
                        differential equations whose variables are concentrations
                        , or as discrete, represented by stochastic processes
                        whose variables are numbers of molecules. Although the
                        former is by far more common, systems with very small
                        numbers of molecules are important in some applications
                        (e.g., in small biological cells or in surface
                        processes). In both views, most complicated systems with
                        multiple reaction channels and multiple chemical species
                        cannot be solved analytically. There are exact numerical
                        simulation methods to simulate trajectories of discrete,
                        stochastic systems, (methods that are rigorously
                        equivalent to the Master Equation approach) but these do
                        not scale well to systems with many reaction pathways.
                        This paper presents the Next Reaction Method, an exact
                        algorithm to simulate coupled chemical reactions that is
                        also efficient: it (a) uses only a single random number
                        per simulation event, and (b) takes time proportional to
                        the logarithm of the number of reactions, not to the
                        number of reactions itself. The Next Reaction Method is
                        extended to include time-dependent rate constants and
                        non-Markov processes and is applied to a sample
                        application in biology (the lysis/lysogeny decision
                        circuit of lambda phage). The performance of the Next
                        Reaction Method on this application is compared with one
                        standard method and an optimized version of that standard
                        method. },

                        not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines
                        dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous
                        entities. However, there is no standard protocol for
                        describing such simulation models, which can make them
                        difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper
                        presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for
                        describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28
                        modellers who cover a wide range of fields within
                        ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview
                        , Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided
                        into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales,
                        Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts,
                        Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which
                        aspects of a model should be described in each element,
                        and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in
                        use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online
                        Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for
                        establishing a more detailed common format of the
                        description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the
                        protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a
                        sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

                        essentially exact procedure for numerically simulating
                        the time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting
                        system. Despite recent major improvements in the
                        efficiency of the SSA, its drawback remains the great
                        amount of computer time that is often required to
                        simulate a desired amount of system time. Presented here
                        is the “τ-leap” method, an approximate procedure that in
                        some circumstances can produce significant gains in
                        simulation speed with acceptable losses in accuracy. Some
                        primitive strategies for control parameter selection and
                        error mitigation for the τ-leap method are described, and
                        simulation results for two simple model systems are
                        exhibited. With further refinement, the τ-leap method
                        should provide a viable way of segueing from the exact
                        SSA to the approximate chemical Langevin equation, and
                        thence to the conventional deterministic reaction rate
                        equation, as the system size becomes larger.},

            abstract = {Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES), sometimes
                        called distributed simulation, refers to the execution of
                        a single discrete event simulation program on a parallel
                        computer. PDES has attracted a considerable amount of
                        interest in recent years. From a pragmatic standpoint,
                        this interest arises from the fact that large simulations
                        in engineering, computer science, economics, and military
                        applications, to mention a few, consume enormous amounts
                        of time on sequential machines. From an academic point of
                        view, parallel simulation is interesting because it
                        represents a problem domain that often contains
                        substantial amounts of parallelism (e.g., see [59]), yet
                        paradoxically, is surprisingly difficult to parallelize
                        in practice. A sufficiently general solution to the PDES
                        problem may lead to new insights in parallel computation
                        as a whole. Historically, the irregular, data-dependent
                        nature of PDES programs has identified it as an
                        application where vectorization techniques using
                        supercomputer hardware provide little benefit [14].A
                        discrete event simulation model assumes the system being
                        simulated only changes state at discrete points in
                        simulated time. The simulation model jumps from one state
                        to another upon the occurrence of an event. For example,
                        a simulator of a store-and-forward communication network
                        might include state variables to indicate the length of
                        message queues, the status of communication links (busy
                        or idle), etc. Typical events might include arrival of a
                        message at some node in the network, forwarding a message
                        to another network node, component failures, etc.We are
                        especially concerned with the simulation of asynchronous
                        systems where events are not synchronized by a global
                        clock, but rather, occur at irregular time intervals. For
                        these systems, few simulator events occur at any single
                        point in simulated time; therefore parallelization
                        techniques based on lock-step execution using a global
                        simulation clock perform poorly or require assumptions in
                        the timing model that may compromise the fidelity of the
                        simulation. Concurrent execution of events at different
                        points in simulated time is required, but as we shall
                        soon see, this introduces interesting synchronization
                        problems that are at the heart of the PDES problem.This
                        article deals with the execution of a simulation program
                        on a parallel computer by decomposing the simulation
                        application into a set of concurrently executing
                        processes. For completeness, we conclude this section by
                        mentioning other approaches to exploiting parallelism in
                        simulation problems.Comfort and Shepard et al. have
                        proposed using dedicated functional units to implement
                        specific sequential simulation functions, (e.g., event
                        list manipulation and random number generation [20, 23,
                        47]). This method can provide only a limited amount of
                        speedup, however. Zhang, Zeigler, and Concepcion use the
                        hierarchical decomposition of the simulation model to
                        allow an event consisting of several subevents to be
                        processed concurrently [21, 98]. A third alternative is
                        to execute independent, sequential simulation programs on
                        different processors [11, 39]. This replicated trials
                        approach is useful if the simulation is largely
                        stochastic and one is performing long simulation runs to
                        reduce variance, or if one is attempting to simulate a
                        specific simulation problem across a large number of
                        different parameter settings. However, one drawback with
                        this approach is that each processor must contain
                        sufficient memory to hold the entire simulation.
                        Furthermore, this approach is less suitable in a design
                        environment where results of one experiment are used to
                        determine the experiment that should be performed next
                        because one must wait for a sequential execution to be
                        completed before results are obtained.},
