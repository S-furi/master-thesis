@book{WinsbergEric2010Sita,
            abstract = {Computer simulation was first pioneered as a scientific
                        tool in meteorology and nuclear physics in the period
                        following World War II, but it has grown rapidly to
                        become indispensible in a wide variety of scientific
                        disciplines, including astrophysics, high-energy physics,
                        climate science, engineering, ecology, and economics.
                        Digital computer simulation helps study phenomena of
                        great complexity, but how much do we know about the
                        limits and possibilities of this new scientific practice?
                        How do simulations compare to traditional experiments?
                        And are they reliable? Eric Winsberg seeks to answer
                        these questions in Science in the Age of Computer
                        Simulation. Scrutinizing these issue with a philosophical
                        lens, Winsberg explores the impact of simulation on such
                        issues as the nature of scientific evidence; the role of
                        values in science; the nature and role of fictions in
                        science; and the relationship between simulation and
                        experiment, theories and data, and theories at different
                        levels of description. Science in the Age of Computer
                        Simulation will transform many of the core issues in
                        philosophy of science, as well as our basic understanding
                        of the role of the digital computer in the sciences.},
